// MARK: - WARNING — do NOT read from ArtworkImageCache in CoverArtView.body
//
// ArtworkImageCache is @Observable. Any property access in a view's body creates
// an observation dependency on the WHOLE cache dictionary — not just the one key
// being read. When any cover arrives (i.e., cache[key] = image), every CoverArtView
// whose body observed the dictionary is invalidated and re-evaluated.
//
// With N history rows × M covers loading = N×M body re-evaluations. At 13 rows ×
// 13 covers = 169 redundant body calls on search open, cascading into parent list
// re-renders. Measured as ~20 consecutive SearchHistoryListView.body re-renders.
//
// The fix: never read artworkCache in CoverArtView.body. CoverArtViewContent owns
// @State private var cachedImage and a .task that loads exactly one id. Only THAT
// view's body re-renders when its own @State changes — cache mutations for other ids
// are invisible to it.

/// Async cover art loader. Resolves via ArtworkImageCache (RAM → disk → network).
/// Falls back to the URL/AsyncImage path only if ArtworkImageCache fails entirely.
/// Use `CoverArtCard` in views — it wraps this with clip, shadow, and border handling.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - size: Requested pixel size, used for the AsyncImage fallback URL only.
///           Tier is auto-detected: `size >= 480` → `.hero` (1200 px decode);
///           `size < 480` → `.thumb` (480 px decode).
///   - tier: Optional explicit tier override. Pass `.hero` for detail-view hero images
///           whose pixel size is below 480 (e.g. macOS DetailHeroView at 280 px).
